# About Me
Hello! My name is **MiKindzi Dawson**, but feel free to call me **MiK**. I work as a Project Manager for [Leepfrog Technologies](http://leepfrog.com/) in Coralville, Iowa.  While I initially started with the company as an intern in 2018, I've worked there as a full-time employee since January 2019. Prior to my journey as a _frogger_, I was a student at [Kirkwood Community College](https://www.kirkwood.edu/) and the [University of Iowa](https://uiowa.edu/) from August 2016 to December 2018. Code 102 is my first class with [DeltaV Code School](https://www.deltavcodeschool.com/), and I'm excited for this opportunity to expand my knowledge of code as well as the experience of learning something new. I live in Coralville with my wife, Julie, and our three pets - there's never a dull moment in our house. Outside of my day job I coach club volleyball, and I've been with the [Iowa Rockets Volleyball Club](http://iowarockets.com/) for the last five years. When I'm not at a computer or on a volleyball court, we love to spend time outdoors and with our family.
