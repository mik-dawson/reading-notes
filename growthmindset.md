# Growth Mindset
A _growth mindset_ can be differentiated from a fixed mindset by the lens we use to view obstacles in our lives. A fixed mindset focuses on the past and things that are out of our control. On the other hand, a growth mindset is optimistic about the future and the things that are within our control. When I keep a growth mindset in life, that means I firmly believe that my abilities can be developed through perseverence and effort, and that I'm not limited by a pre-existing talent or intelligence. Through hardwork and this belief, I'm able to achieve my goals and grow wisdom. 

## Note to Self
_To keep myself in a growth mindset, I will remember the following:_
1. Identify "instant gratification monkey syndrome" when faced with obstacles, and call it out so that I can make peace with it. 
2. Step back to view challenges from a different angle so I can keep the full picture in mind - rather than focusing on a singular aspect I'm stuck on at the time. 
3. Process criticism with a reality check, and the mental reminder of what I'm ultimately working to accomplish.
