# Growth Mindset
A **growth mindset** can be differentiated from a ~~fixed mindset~~ with the lens we use to view obstacles in our lives. A fixed mindset focuses on the past and things that are out of our control... whereas a _growth mindset_ is optimistic about the future and the things that are within our control.
