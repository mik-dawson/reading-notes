# Learning Markdown 
## What is Markdown?

**Word** | _Definition_
:---: | :---:
**Markdown** | _a lightweight markup language for generating HTML files_
**Markup Language** | _a markup language is a computer language that uses tags to define elements within a document - it's readable by humans._

**Markdown** uses textual symbols to indicate the structure of the page. This can be compared to when you're working in MS Work and you select **B** in the toolbar at the top of the page to make your text **bold**. 

An example of Markdown:
`**This is a bold statement.**` displays as: 
**This is a bold statement.**

## How do we use Markdown?
GitHub uses Markdown pretty much everywhere! This includes README.md files that are automatically created when you make a new repository, as well as any files that end in '.md'. What's even more useful, is that GitHub Pages will convert your Markdown into an HTML file, apply a theme, and then publish it! _Like the page you're looking at right now._
The exact syntax (_which symbols to use for each desired structure to the page_) is covered in many guides that are available to view. A few of these guides can be found below:
